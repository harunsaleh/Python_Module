#Write a program that creates a dictionary containing any 5 U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values.
#(Use the Internet to get a list of your chosen states and their capitals.)
#The program should quiz the user by displaying the name of each state
#and asking the user to enter that stateâ€™s capital.
#The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.
